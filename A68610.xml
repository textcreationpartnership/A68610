            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Thou ſayeſt righte. Therefore whereas I ſayde that Chriſt not onely brake not the lawe, but alſo dyd moſt fully and perfectly performe the lawe: thou muſt take his ſo dooing to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende in eſpecially a ſatiſfaction for al the ſinnes of them that beleue: for euery man is bounde by the lawe to loue god and his neyghbour perfectly, not inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13117:44"/>
but defynitelye, that is to ſaye, as hauinge regarde of hys owne peculiar callynge. As for examples ſake, if a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate loue God but as ſome other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſon dooth, hée cannot bée ſaide too haue done his duetie, becauſe he is bound to loue god as a magiſtrate, whiche ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dealinge is too bée vnderſtoode of all other kinde of callinges. And Chriſt was ſent to ſuffer for vs the puniſhmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes dew for our ſinnes: which thinge hee performed all his life longe, but ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that Sacrifice of his, wherin he bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came<note place="margin">Phil. 28</note> obedient to hys father vnto death, euen the death of the Croſſe. Therefore by woorkinge in ſufferinge, and by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe himſelfe for vs, he both fulfilled the lawe for vs, and alſo made ſatiſfaction for our ſinnes.</p>

And therfore it ſemeth that his fulfilling of the lawe was not for vs, but for himſelf, that he might purchace

But the former parte cannot well be iuſtified. For ſeynge that this manhoode of his was ioyned too the woord by perſonall vnion, yea and ſo ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as it was moſte holy in it ſelfe, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> think (if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſaid humane nature be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered without the charge of mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which is not of it ſelfe coincident too the manhoode, but inioyned to the ſonne by the father of his owne good wyll, and willinglye vndertaken by the ſonne) I ſay, who can thinke that there was anye defaulte in this manhoode whiche hée had taken vnto him, ſo as it ſhould not foorthe wyth haue byn moſte woorthye of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting lyfe, euen from the very fyrſt moment of the ſaide vnion? Therefore this his beinge bounde too the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the lawe, is not properlye by

thoſe ſeueral mouings. This foundation being laid, I Anſwer three things. The firſt is, that the inſtruments which haue life &amp; are endued with reaſon, (of which ſort bee Angells and men) are ſo ſtyred by god their maker: as that they alſo ſtirre themſelues by an inward ſelfmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of theyr owne, and therfore that in the bringing to paſſe of one action, there mete two cauſes, that is to wit god who is diſſeuered from the Inſtrumente and yet geueth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Inſtrument beginning to moue it ſelfe: and the very inſtrument moouing it ſelfe. Another is, that theſe inſtruments are ſo mooued by God, as that he himſelfe ſtirreth alwayes well, but the inſtruments, (if they be euil) go a contrary motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is to ſay, alwaies amiſſe: but if they be good, ſo as the firſt author who mooueth alwaies well, and the inſtrument which mooueth it, doo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: then foloweth a good and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable worke. The third is, that god ſo mooueth the euil inſtruments, (for it is they only who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue now in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) &amp; they on the other ſide are ſo moued by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, that by reaſon of the dublem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

was of neceſſitye that Chriſt dyed by the ordinance of his father, &amp; yet he dyed willingly: yea and God forbid that euer wee ſhould dye vnwillingly, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding muſt of neceſſitie dy once. And what more? God himſelfe is moſt fréely, yea &amp; moſt willingly good: and yet is it vtterly impoſſible that he ſhold not bée good. Ergo willingneſſe and neceſſity are not repugnant.

Then muſt it bée concluded, that Gods ordinance hangeth in ſuſpence, and that the determination of the caſe (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> trimly ſayeth) is not in the power of the potter, but of the clay. And herevpon wil be grounded another falſe opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that faith hath not his beginnyng of God, but of the will of man, if it bee ſo that Gods foreſight gaue him cauſe too determin vpon his choiſe. Neither is it too the purpoſe to obiect, that faith is not foreſene, foraſmuch as it is a gift of god that commeth in by the waye: but that corruption and vnbeleefe are foreſene, which are naturall in man after his fall.<note place="margin">The nature of contraries in reaſoning</note> For the reaſon of the contraries requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in any caſe, that loke in what degrée faith is placed in the ordinance of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: euen in the ſame degree muſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe or vnbeeleefe bee placed in the ordinance of reprobation. Therefore if ye make faith foreknowen, too bee the cauſe of the ordinance of election (which is vtterlye a poynte of a Pelagian and therefore repealed by <hi>Auſtin</hi>) you muſt needes deeme the ſame alſo of vnbeleefe in the contrarye ordynance of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

faith vnto the ſayd ordinance, (as you needes muſt, for wee be choſen to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to beleue, and not bicauſe wee wold or ſhould beleue) you muſt nedes alſo in the contrary member ſubmit vnbeleefe to the ordinance of reprobation.</p>

Finally to what ende is

all this? For in order of cauſes, gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance gooeth before the very creation of mankind: onleſſe thou wilt make god ſo vnwiſe a workman, as too create man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind before he had determined with him ſelf, to what end he wold make him. And what could he ſée in them that as yet had no being, whereby he might be moued to determine this or that concerning them? Therfore this diſcourſe alſo perteineth not to the ordinance, but to the execucion of the ordinance: wherin notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding (as I ſayd euen now) there can no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialitie or accepting of perſons be found.</p>

corruption of mankinde before it.

Furthermore hee ſhoulde ſpeake vnproperly, too ſay, that veſſelles of wrath are made of that lumpe. For if that lumpe betokened men corrupted: then were they veſſels of diſhonour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and the potter ſhould not be ſaide too make them, other than ſuch as they had made them ſelues already.</p>
            <p>Finially ſo ſhoulde the cauſe as well of the ordinaunce of Reprobation, as of the execution of the ſame ordinance (that is too wit of the damnation of the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate) bee manyfeſt: for men ſhould ſee, it were corruption.

The reſt haue not ſo much as the will too thinke any thing aright, and much leſſe too doo it, conſidering that too will aright and too doo aright commeth of Gods grace, which is peculiar only to the chozen.

<pb facs="tcp:13117:88"/>
that they ſhalbe ſaued if they bee choſen, what kynd of life ſo euer they giue them ſelues vnto. For as many as bee choſen, are the children of God, but if they bee Gods children, then alſo (as the Apoſtle<note place="margin">Ro. 8. 14</note> ſayeth) they beeled by Gods ſpirit. And therfore the elect truely cannot periſhe: (for then ſhould gods ordinance faile, or elſe at leaſt wiſe God ſhould bee change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able), but like as they cannot periſhe, ſo alſo are they in their ſeaſonable time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with faith, and ingreffed in chriſt in whom finally they be iuſtified, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and glorified.</p>

ſay in reſpect of his owne wil, albeit that it were of neceſſitie if yee conſider Gods ordinance and the ſequele of the matter. From thenſforth the Lorde, (accordinge as he had determined fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerlaſtinge,) bringing forth now ſom and then ſome, doth ſo leade them forth too their appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted endes too bee glorifyed in them on either ſide: that of them in whom he wil haue his glory to appéere by their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome he remoueth out of hande too eternall life as freely compriſed within his couenant: and otherſome (whome it pleaſeth him too haue too continewe lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in this life,) he calleth by the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28 &amp;c.</note> woorde of the Goſpell, ſometime ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer and ſomtime later, at what time he liſteth, and greffeth them into Chriſt, in whom he iuſtifieth them, ſanctifieth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and finallye rewardeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with eternall life.

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it commeth to paſſe, that being left vp too their owne luſtes, they harden themſelues, vntill they haue filled vp the full meaſure of wickednes, and then they paſſe awaye vntoo iudgement.
